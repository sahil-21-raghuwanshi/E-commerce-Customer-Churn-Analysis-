# E-commerce-Customer-Churn-Analysis
Welcome to the Customer Churn Analysis Project repository! This project aims to analyze customer churn patterns and provide insights and recommendations to reduce churn rates. The analysis is based on a dataset containing various customer attributes and behaviors.
## What is Customer churn
Customer churn refers to the situation when customers decide to stop doing business with a company. This is a significant concern for businesses, as it hampers customer retention and overall success. In the fast-paced world of online retail, e-commerce companies face the challenge of retaining customers. To address this, identifying at-risk customers and implementing targeted retention strategies are crucial. This article presents a detailed analysis of a dataset from an online retail company, revealing valuable insights on customer churn. These insights offer essential guidance for decision-making, enabling proactive measures to reduce attrition and foster long-term loyalty. By understanding the factors driving churn, companies can mitigate attrition by providing appealing promotions and ensuring ongoing customer engagement.

## Project Approach
I got this dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitverma2010/ecommerce-customer-churn-analysis-and-prediction?sort=most-comments), and it contains information such as customers' personal details, satisfaction scores, preferred payment mode, days since the last order, and cashback amount. I used SQL (Azure Data Studio) to clean and analyze this dataset, and performed visualizations using Microsoft Power BI. This analysis is divided into several stages: data cleaning, data exploration, an insight section, and recommendations.
